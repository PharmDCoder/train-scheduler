Welcome to Global Consolidated Transportation, Inc. Employee Portal.

At Global Consolidated Transportation we value efficiency and therefor your metrics will be tracked to ensure you are maximizing profits for our share holders.  Your performance data is measured against your coworkers in real time to determine the next round of lay-offs.

Use the NavBar at the top of the screen to navigate the portal.

Click on "View Current Schedule" to see the current data for all scheduled trains.

Click on "Add Train" to navigate to the screen to add trains:
    - fill in the blank fields
        - make sure to input frequency in minutes and arrival time in military time
    - click submit to add the train to the schedule

Click on "Remove Screen" to navigate to the remove train screen.
    - click on the row of the train to select it
    - click delete button to remove train.


****Development time was short but full application would have:

1.  Employee login (clip from Anima of T. Yorke climbing an incline in the shadows of anonymous people climbing to the top and then everyone falling down on a loop to symbolize the corporate ladder.)

2.  4th option in NavBar called "Career Management"
    - click on to screen that asks if you would like to quit your job
        - if no, screen will tell you that you are wasting time and to get back to scheduling trains and threaten termination for poor performance
        - if yes, play end of Anima Video (where Thom Yorke breaks free from the train station and is able to dance freely and enjoy life on the outside)

3.  Try to parse music into loops so that as things are happening a specific part of the song plays seemlessly transitioning b/w screens to create a remix.
